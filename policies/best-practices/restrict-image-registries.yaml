      Images from unknown, public registries can be of dubious quality and may not be
      scanned and secured, representing a high degree of risk. Requiring use of known, approved
      registries helps reduce threat exposure by ensuring image pulls only come from them. This
      policy validates that container images only originate from the registry `eu.foo.io` or
      `bar.io`. Use of this policy requires customization to define your allowable registries.
