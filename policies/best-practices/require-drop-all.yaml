      Capabilities permit privileged actions without giving full root access. All
      capabilities should be dropped from a Pod, with only those required added back.
      This policy ensures that all containers explicitly specify the `drop: ["ALL"]`
      ability. Note that this policy also illustrates how to cover drop entries in any
      case although this may not strictly conform to the Pod Security Standards.
